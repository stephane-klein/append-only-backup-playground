# Object Storage append-only backup playground

In this "playground" repository, I explore different methods to configure object storage services in [**append-only**](https://notes.sklein.xyz/Write%20Once%20Read%20Many/) or [Write Once Read Many](https://notes.sklein.xyz/Write%20Once%20Read%20Many/) (WORM) mode.

Playgrounds:

- [./scaleway/](./scaleway/)
- [./scaleway-object-lock/](./scaleway-object-lock/)
- [./backblaze/](./backblaze/)
- [./backblaze-object-lock/](./backblaze-object-lock/)
